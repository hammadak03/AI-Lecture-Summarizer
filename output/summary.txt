A firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorized access from entering a private
network by filtering the information that comes in from the internet. A firewall is especially
important to a large organization that has a lot of computers and servers in them because you don't
want all those devices accessible to everyone.
Firewalls come in different types and one type is called a host based firewall and this is a
software firewall. This is the kind of firewall that is installed on a computer and it protects that
computer only. A network based firewall is a combination of hardware and software.
